"""comprehensive sample problem that will help you recall and use all major types of Python operators, including:

1. Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, **, %, //)
2. Assignment operators (=, :=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, ...., &=, |=, ^= : biwise-xor, >>=, <<=)
3. Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
4. Logical operators    (and , or, not)
5. Bitwise operators    ( &, |, ^ : XOR, ~, <<, >>)
6. Identity operators   (is, is not) : used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location
7. Membership operators (in, not in) : used to test if a sequence is presented in an object

ðŸ§  Problem: Python Operator Mastery

a = 10
b = 5
c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]
d = 0b1010  # binary for 10
e = 0b0101  # binary for 5

âœ… Task: Write a function operator_practice(a, b, c, d, e) that:

1. Performs arithmetic operations and stores:
    - sum, difference, product, quotient, modulus, exponentiation, floor division.

2. Uses assignment operators to modify a variable:
    - Start with x = a, then successively apply +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=

3. Compares a and b using all comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)

4. Applies logical operators (and, or, not) on some comparison results.

5. Applies bitwise operations between d and e:
    - AND, OR, XOR, NOT (on d), left shift, right shift.

6. Checks membership and identity:
    - Is a in c?
    - Is a not in c?
    - Does a is b?
    - Does a is not b?

7. Return all results in a dictionary for inspection.
